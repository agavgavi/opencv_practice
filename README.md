# OpenCV Practice Repository Using Qt Creator and Qt
This will be the location where I work through OpenCV tutorials to learn attributes necessary for coding with OpenCV in Carson 151C for UCSC Fall 2020.
	
Each class within OpenCV_Practice will be a different example that can be commented and uncommented out when needed for keeping everything in 1 folder.
